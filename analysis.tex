\section{Prediction}

The chance any of the first five characters the final correct character is $0\%$.

The chances the sixth most recent character is correct is $10\%$; the sixth and fifth most recent characters $1\%$; sixth, fifth, and fourth $0.1\%$; sixth, fifth, fourth, and third $0.01\%$; sixth to second $0.001\%$; and sixth to first $0.0001\%$.

The chance for an input to be the final character in the unlock sequence is therfore $0.0001\%$ after $5$ characters have been entered.

The average time for the code to be guessed should then be ${1\over0.000001}+5=1000005$ seconds or approximatly $4.63$ hours.

\section{Reults}

After 33857348790 input characters attempts and 33890 unlocks, my code unlocked after an average of 999036 characters. An error rate of 0.0009689\%.
